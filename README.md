Hack the Hood Build Program

A Data Science bootcamp where I learned how to use different data visualization libraries in Python such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Throughout the bootcamp we did different assignments to practice including our own project, where I chose my own dataset to do an analysis on. The analysis also included a machine learning algorithm using a Python library, Scikit-Learn.
