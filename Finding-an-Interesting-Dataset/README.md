# Why was I interested in this dataset?
The dataset that I have chosen was on heart failure. I'm interested in science whether it be biology and chemistry. So anything health or science related is something I want to learn more about. I hope to understand who is more likely to have heart failure in terms of BMI, sex, if they have diabetes, etc.

# Questions for the dataset: 
1. Are males or females more likely to die from heart failure?
2. What is the average age that people are prone to heart failure?
3. What is the average ejection fraction from survival of heart failure?
4. Is survival more likely with lower or high serum creatinine?
5. Is diabetes more common in males or females?
6. Is high blood pressure more common in males or females?
7. Is anemia more common in males or females?
8. According to the John Hopkins Medicine, having too many platelets in your blood can lead to things like a heart attack or stroke. A normal range is 150,000 to 450,000, how many people have higher than normal platelets count?

9. What is the average level of creatinine phosphokinase in people who survived and those who did not?
10. What is the average of serum sodium?
