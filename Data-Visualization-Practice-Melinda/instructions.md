# Instructions  

Here we have a dataset that has information about all the passengers who were abroad the tragic voyage of the Titanic. Here is a description of the features in this data:

VARIABLE | DESCRIPTION
:-:|:-
survival | Did the passenger survive the collision and rescue? (0 = No ; 1 = Yes)
pclass | In what class was the passenger traveling? (1 = 1st ; 2 = 2nd ; 3 = 3rd)
name | Passenger's name
sex | Passenger's gender
age | Passenger's age
sibsp | Number of siblings/spouses that were aboard with the passenger
parch | Number of parents/children that were aboard with the passenger
ticket | Passenger's ticket number
fare | Price the passenger paid for their ticket
cabin | Cabin of the ship where the passenger is lodging
embarked | Port where the passenger boarded the Titanic (C = Cherbourg ; Q = Queenstown ; S = Southampton)

Follow the instructions to use your new knowledge of Python's Pandas library to manipulate the data and answer the prompts.

## Steps
No.| To Do
:-:|:-
1|  Create a heatmap showing the correlation between the following features: survival, pclass, sex, age, and fare
2| Create a bar graph that illustrates how many passengers fell into each of these age ranges: 0 - 16, 17 - 25, 26 -40, 41 - 59, 60 or older
3| Create a line graph showing the average survival percentage of each of the previous age groups
4| Create a pie chart that shows the percentage of survivors that were male and the percentage of survivors that were female
5| Create a histogram that shows the distribution of passengers between the three embarking locations: C (Cherbourg), Q (Queenstown), S (Southampton)

Once you have completed all the steps above, you can download this replit assignment into your program work folder and upload it to your github repo. Finally, submit the assignment here and on google classroom.
